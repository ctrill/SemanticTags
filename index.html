    <h1><strong>THE IMPORTANCE OF SEMANTIC TAGS</strong></h1>
    <h2>Boy, this stuff ain't easy</h2>

        <h3><b>ELEMENTS</b></h3>
          <p>The makeup of any HTML document requires descendants of the primary html tag which provide function and structure.</p>  
          <hr>
          <p>Above, I have noted a <b>thematic break</b> in the paragraph-level elements.</p>
          <p>The HTML main element represents the main content of the body.  Now here's a cool quote:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <i>Reading and writing, like everything else,<br>
            improve with practice.  And, of course,<br>
            if there are no young readers and writers,<br>
            there will shortly be no older ones.<br>
            Literacy will be dead, and democracy<br>
            which many believe goes hand in hand with it<br>
            will be dead as well.</i><br>

          <h3><b>TUTORIAL</b></h3>
            <p><strong>There are certain CSS rules that regard link relations:</strong></p>
            <img src="http://gifgifs.com/animations/computers-technology/email/flying_envelope_2.gif" alt="Flying Envelope" style="width: auto; height: auto; vertical-align: middle" /> 
            <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS Tutorial</a>
            <p>To the left of the link, I place an animated gif of a flying envelope.  In this way, I am showing both the capability of alignment, size, width, and linkage.  I don't know what that means, but I wanted to type enough for the text to wrap below it</p>
